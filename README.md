# Programming with MoonBit: A Modern Approach

Welcome to the [_**Programming with MoonBit**: A Modern Approach_](https://moonbitlang.github.io/moonbit-textbook/) course.

Programming is a subject with a long history, dating back to the 19th century when Ada Lovelace wrote early programs. Since then, after a century of evolution, programming languages have emerged like mushrooms after rain, various programming paradigms have been proposed, and various industries have gradually had digital demands, with the scale of software development becoming increasingly large. In this context, we are launching this public course, aimed at allowing more people to get in touch with programming, understand modern programming concepts, and master the essentials of software development.

The course mainly focuses on program design and practical applications. It will introduce various programming paradigms, including functional programming, imperative programming, and object-oriented programming. At the same time, it will demonstrate how to use the [MoonBit](https://moonbitlang.com/) programming language to develop complex software projects.

The course is suitable for a wide audience, from programming beginners to experienced developers. No specific prerequisites are required, and we will continue to refine the course to provide clear and understandable content.
