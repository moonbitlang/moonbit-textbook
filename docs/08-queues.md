# 8. Queues

Queues are a fundamental data structure in computer science, following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. The chapter will explore two primary methods of implementing queues: circular queues and singly linked lists. Additionally, it will also introduce tail calls and tail recursion, which are essential for optimizing recursive functions.

## Basic Operations

A queue should support the following basic operations:

```moonbit no-check
struct Queue { .. }

fn make() -> Queue // Creates an empty queue.
fn push(self: Queue, t: Int) -> Queue // Adds an integer element to the queue.
fn pop(self: Queue) -> Queue // Removes an element from the queue.
fn peek(self: Queue) -> Int // Views the front element of the queue.
fn length(self: Queue) -> Int // Obtains the length of the queue.
```

The `pop` and `push` operations will directly modify the original queue. For convenience, we also return the modified queue, so that we can easily make chain calls.

```moonbit no-check
make().push(1).push(2).push(3).pop().pop().length() // 1
```

## Circular Queues

Circular queues are usually implemented using arrays, which provide a continuous storage space where each position can be modified. Once an array is allocated, its length remains fixed.

The following code snippet shows the basic usage of the built-in `Array` in MoonBit. It is worth noting that its index starts from 0, and we will later learn the benefits of doing so.

```moonbit expr
let a: Array[Int] = Array::make(5, 0)
a[0] = 1
a[1] = 2
println(a) // Output: [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]
```

When implementing a circular queue, we keep track of the `start` and `end` indices. Whenever a new element is pushed, we move the `end` index one step forward. The `pop` operation clears the element at the position of `start` and moves it one step forward. If the index exceeds the length of the array, we wrap it back to the beginning.

The following diagram is a demonstration of these operations. First, we create an empty queue by calling `make()`. At this point, the `start` and `end` indices both point to the first element. Then, we push an element into the queue by calling `push(1)`. The element `1` is then added to the position pointed to by `end`, and the `end` index is updated. Afterwards, we call `push(2)` to push another element into the queue, and finally call `pop()` to pop out the first element we have pushed.

Now, let's take a look at another situation when we are close to the end of the array. At this point, `end` points to the position of the last element of the array. When we push an element, `end` cannot move forward, so we wrap it back to the beginning of the array. Then, we perform two `pop` operations. Similarly, when `start` exceeds the length of the array, it returns to the beginning of the list.

![](/pics/circle_list_back.drawio.svg)

With the above basic ideas in mind, we can easily define the `Queue` struct and implement the `push` operation as follows:

```moonbit
struct Queue {
  mut array: Array[Int]
  mut start: Int
  mut end: Int // end points to the empty position at the end of the queue
  mut length: Int
}

fn push(self: Queue, t: Int) -> Queue {
  self.array[self.end] = t
  self.end = (self.end + 1) % self.array.length() // wrap around to the start of the array if beyond the end
  self.length = self.length + 1
  self
}
```

Now, we can easily see the benefit of using `0` as the starting index of an array: we can conveniently achieve the "circular" effect with the `%` operation.

However, the above implementation has a potential issue, which is that the number of elements in the queue may exceed the length of the array. When we know the upper limit of the number of elements, we can avoid this issue by defining an array that is long enough. If we cannot know the upper limit in advance, we can "expand" the array by replacing it with a longer array. A sample implementation is as follows:

```moonbit
fn _push(self: Queue, t: Int) -> Queue {
  if self.length == self.array.length() {
    let new_array: Array[Int] = Array::make(self.array.length() * 2, 0)
    let mut i = 0
    while i < self.array.length() {
      new_array[i] = self.array[(self.start + i) % self.array.length()]
      i = i + 1
    }
    self.start = 0
    self.end = self.array.length()
    self.array = new_array
  }
  self.push(t)
}
```

When we pop out an element, we remove the element pointed to by `start`, move `start` forward, and update the length.

```moonbit
fn pop(self: Queue) -> Queue {
  self.array[self.start] = 0
  self.start = (self.start + 1) % self.array.length()
  self.length = self.length - 1
  self
}
```

The `length` function simply returns the current `length` field of the queue, since it is dynamically maintained.

```moonbit
fn length(self: Queue) -> Int {
  self.length
}
```

### Generic Circular Queues

Sometimes, we may want the elements in the queue to be of a type other than `Int`. With MoonBit's generic mechanism, we can easily define a generic version of the `Queue` struct.

```moonbit no-check
struct Queue[T] {
  mut array: Array[T]
  mut start: Int
  mut end: Int // end points to the empty position at the end of the queue
  mut length: Int
}
```

However, when implementing the `make` operation, how do we specify the initial value for the array? There are two options: one is to wrap the values with `Option` and use `Option::None` as the initial value; the other option is to use the default value of the type itself. How to define and utilize this default value will be discussed in Chapter 9.

```moonbit no-check
fn make[T]() -> Queue[T] {
  {
    array: Array::make(5, T::default()), // Initialize the array with the default value of the type
    start: 0,
    end: 0,
    length: 0
  }
}
```

## Singly Linked Lists

Singly linked lists are composed of nodes, where each node contains a value and a mutable reference to the next node.

`Node[T]` is a generic struct that represents a node in a linked list. It has two fields: `val` and `next`. The `val` field is used to store the value of the node, and its type is `T`, which can be any valid data type. The `next` field represents the reference to the next node in the linked list. It is an optional field that can either hold a reference to the next node or be empty (`None`), indicating the end of the linked list.

```moonbit
struct Node[T] {
  val : T
  mut next : Option[Node[T]]
}
```

`LinkedList[T]` is a generic struct that represents a linked list. It has two mutable fields: `head` and `tail`. The `head` field represents the reference to the first node (head) of the linked list and is initially set to `None` when the linked list is empty. The `tail` field represents the reference to the last node (tail) of the linked list and is also initially set to `None`. The presence of the `tail` field allows for efficient appending of new nodes to the end of the linked list.

```moonbit
struct LinkedList[T] {
  mut head : Option[Node[T]]
  mut tail : Option[Node[T]]
}
```

The implementation of `make` is trivial:

```moonbit
fn LinkedList::make[T]() -> LinkedList[T] {
  { head: None, tail: None }
}
```

When we push elements, we first check whether the linked list is empty. If not, add it to the end of the queue and maintain the linked list relationship.

```moonbit
fn push[T](self: LinkedList[T], value: T) -> LinkedList[T] {
  let node = { val: value, next: None }
  match self.tail {
    None => {
      self.head = Some(node)
      self.tail = Some(node)
    }
    Some(n) => {
      n.next = Some(node)
      self.tail = Some(node)
    }
  }
  self
}
```

The following diagram is a simple demonstration. When we create a linked list by calling `make()`, both the `head` and `tail` are empty. When we push an element using `push(1)`, we create a new node and point both the `head` and `tail` to this node. When we push more elements, say `push(2)` and then `push(3)`, we need to update the `next` field of the current `tail` node to point to the new node. The `tail` node of the linked list should always point to the latest node.

![](/pics/linked_list_2.drawio.svg)

To get the length of the list, we can either record it in the struct as we did for circular queues, or we can use a naive recursive function to calculate it.

```moonbit
fn length[T](self : LinkedList[T]) -> Int {
  fn aux(node : Option[Node[T]]) -> Int {
    match node {
      None => 0
      Some(node) => 1 + aux(node.next)
    }
  }
  aux(self.head)
}
```

### Stack Overflow

However, if the list is too long, the above implementation may lead to a stack overflow.

```moonbit no-check
fn init {
  let list = make()
  let mut i = 0
  while i < 100000 {
    let _ = list.push(i)
    i += 1
  }
  println(list.length())
}
```

![](/pics/overflow.webp)

The cause of a stack overflow is that, whenever we call a function recursively, the data (or environments) waiting to be calculated in the current layer of function call is temporarily saved in a memory space called the "stack". When we return to the current layer from a deeper recursion, the data saved in the stack space will be recovered to continue the calculation of the current function. In our case, each time we call `aux` recursively, we will store the information for the partial expression `1 + ...` in the stack space, so that we can continue the calculation after we returned from the recursive calls.

However, the size of the stack space is limited. Therefore, if we store data on the stack every time we recurse, the stack will overflow as long as the number of recursive layers is large enough.

### Taill Calls and Tail Recursion

To avoid the stack overflow issues, we can rewrite recursive functions as loops to avoid using stack space. Alternatively, we can adjust the recursive function's implementation so that each recursion does not need to preserve any environment on the stack. To achieve this, we need to ensure that the last operation of a function is a function call, known as a tail call. And if the last operation is a recursive call to the function itself, it is called tail recursion. Since the result of the function call is the final result of the computation, we don't need to preserve the current computation environment.

As shown in the code below, we can rewrite the `length` function to make it tail recursive:

```moonbit
fn length_[T](self: LinkedList[T]) -> Int {
  fn aux2(node: Option[Node[T]], cumul: Int) -> Int {
    match node {
      None => cumul
      Some(node) => aux2(node.next, 1 + cumul)
    }
  }
  // tail recursive
  aux2(self.head, 0)
}
```

The optimized `length_` function uses tail recursion to calculate the length of the linked list without risking a stack overflow. The `aux2` function uses an accumulator `cumul` to keep track of the length as it traverses the list. The last function call in each iteration is `aux2` itself, so we can call it recursively as many times as we want without encountering a stack overflow issue.

## Summary

This chapter covers the design and implementation of two basic types of queues, i.e., circular queues and singly linked lists. It also highlights the importance of understanding and utilizing tail calls and tail recursion to optimize recursive functions and prevent stack overflow, ultimately leading to more efficient and stable program performance.
