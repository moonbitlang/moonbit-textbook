# Overview

### Modern Programming Ideology

Welcome to the "Modern Programming Ideology" course. This course mainly focuses on program design and practical applications. It will introduce various programming paradigms, including functional programming, imperative programming, and object-oriented programming. At the same time, we will demonstrate how to use the MoonBit programming language to develop complex software projects.

Firstly, and most importantly, all course support and discussion is on our MoonBit Discord server. It is very important that you join the community. Join the server [here](https://discord.gg/dnCme9Un2w) as your first task.

However, you can study the course without joining if you cannot or do not want to join the community.

### What is this course for?

Programming is a subject with a long history, dating back to the 19th century when Ada Lovelace wrote early programs. Since then, after a century of evolution, programming languages have emerged like mushrooms after rain, various programming paradigms have been proposed, and various industries have gradually had digital demands, with the scale of software development becoming increasingly large.

In this context, we are launching the Modern Programming Ideology public course, aimed at allowing more people to get in touch with programming, understand Modern Programming Ideology, and master the essentials of software development.

This course is suitable for a wide audience, from programming beginners to experienced developers. No specific prerequisites are required, and we will continue to refine the course to provide clear and understandable content.

The course will adopt various teaching methods, including recorded lectures, practical projects, programming exercises, and forum discussions. Additionally, we will provide online slides, code repositories, recommended readings, and other learning resources to support students' learning.

The example code used in teaching is written in [MoonBit](https://moonbitlang.com/). MoonBit supports multi-paradigm programming and provides support for cloud-native development environments, allowing development in the browser without the need to install additional software.
